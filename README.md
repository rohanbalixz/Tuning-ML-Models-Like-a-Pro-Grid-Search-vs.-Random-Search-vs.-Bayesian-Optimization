# Tuning ML Models Like a Pro: Grid Search vs. Random Search vs. Bayesian Optimization ðŸ“Š

Hyper-parameter tuning can elevate a good model to a great one, but picking the right search strategy can save you hours of trial and error!

## Search Strategies

- âœ… **Grid Search:** Exhaustive but slow, great for small search spaces.
- âœ… **Random Search:** Quick and effective, ideal when hyper-parameters are abundant.
- âœ… **Bayesian Optimization:** The smart approach that efficiently finds the best parameters using probability.

**NOTE:** The right hyper-parameter tuning method can save you hours of computation while delivering superior model performance.
